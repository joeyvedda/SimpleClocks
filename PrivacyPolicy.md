Simple Clocks Privacy Policy

A note from the developer:
  I am deeply committed to online privacy, not only for myself, but for my users. Therefore, I make it a priority to protect user privacy in every way possible. I attempt to be as straightforward and easy to understand as possible. With that being said -

- Simple Clocks does not have any first or third party trackers. Your preferences, usage, and other data including widget selection, are entirely processed on device.

- Your purchase history is collected, if and only if you make a purchase. This information is linked to an anonymous ID, and is solely used for receipt validation and purchase analytics. More information can be found below.

Third Party
  To process purchases Simple Clocks uses RevenueCat. When you make a purchase, as mentioned above, it is linked to an anonomyous ID. Neither I or RevenueCat can see the user that purchased. This ID is solely used for receipt validation and purchase analytics. More information can be found at RevenueCat's website linked below.
